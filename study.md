# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

- NoSQL encompases a wide variety of technologies that allow tech comapines to produce/develop faster more versitile apps.
- Relational db's  weren't designed to deal with the demand and scale of the industry

### NoSQL
There are different NoSQL db's
- Document db - keys are paired with complex data structure like documents. They can containg many key-value pairs, nested docs etc.
- Graph stores- used to srore network information like sm connections.
- Key-value stores - very simple db type where everything in in the db is stored as an attibutes.
- Wide colunm stores- db type optimized for queries over lg datasets. It stores columns and data together instead of rows.

- NoSQL DB's are more scalable. They apparently addres  several issues that relational DB's aren't designed to do.
  - Agile sprints
  - Object oriented programming

### NoSQL vs. SQL

- There is only one kind of SQL DB
- There are different types of NoSQL  DB's


- SQL has been around since the 70's
- NoSQL has been around since the early 00's

- SQL stores individual records as their own rows in a table with each column storing data about the record. Related data is stored in another table and then joined.
- NoSQL has many variations depending on the type of DB you may need.

-  SQL DB requires you to have a prefdefined schema before you add data
- NoSQL is more dynamic.
