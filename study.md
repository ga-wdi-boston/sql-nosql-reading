    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NoSQL is a non-relational database which is made to store complex types of data
in which the relational database is difficult to do.

### Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are appropriate.
If the relationship of data is not neccessary and important for a case, then using
non-relational databases is more flexibility for complex data types and efficiency.

If the relationship of data is important and complex, such as social data , then using
relationship databases is neccessary.

### List three strengths of relational databases
- strong consistency
- spread databases over many servers
- avoid dupplicated data

### List three strengths of non-relational databases.
- is able to store complex data types
- easy to add different type of data
- dynamic schemas
