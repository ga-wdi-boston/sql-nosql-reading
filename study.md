# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Advantages of noSQL --

  Have many different ways of storing data, including key-value pairs,
  document databases, wide-column stores and graph databases.

  flexible schema

  Designed to allow the insertion of data without a predefined schema.

  Allows developers to make significant application changes in real time.

  Spreads data across an arbitrary number of servers without the application,
  needing to worry about which serves are being used.

  The benifit being, if a server goes down, it can be replaced without,
  disruption in service.

  non-relation databases would be appropriate when building a mobile app, that
  may have millions of users.  The ability to be flexible with what type of data
  it stores is key.

  Relational databases would be useful for social networking, because there are
  links between the data.  Users, profiles, comments, pictures ect...

  If there is value in the links between the data, you are going to need to use
  a relational database.

  Relational databases are reliable, and with caching can be just as fast.

  Allows you to have 'Relations' between your data.  More long term flexibility.
