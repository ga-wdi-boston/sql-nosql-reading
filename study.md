# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

If you don't know what kind of data/database you need, or if you'll be changing
your database frequently as you grow, you'll want some sort of way to collect
all types of non pre-specified data without having to run a bunch of migrations
that may require a ton of downtime.

Strengths of relational databases: stable, predictable, easy to determine what
they're used for simply by looking at them

Strengths of non-relational: more scalable, work with sprints - can be updated
more readily, can store unstructured data, can hold multipe values (arrays)
within fields
