## Summary

<!-- your notes here -->

Relational databases would be used for simpler data forms.  They are fast, easy to understand, and are not scaleable.

Non-relational databases would be used for more complex data types.  They can handle large filetypes, can be
easily scaled, and cost less to put into production.
