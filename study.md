# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NoSQL has more than just the traditional table format in Postgres : its tables can be in the form of key-value pairs, document databases, wide-column stores, and graph databases.

NoSql only have two columns per table: key and value.

Newer than Sql and Postgres (mongodb developed in 2000's while the other SQL's were developed in 1970's)

NoSql can be hosted over multiple servers.  Traditional SQL is hosted on just one server.

NoSql is open-source developed.

Data manipulation in traditional sql is through specific language like SELECT ALL FROM TABLE WHERE...
whereas NoSql is data manipulation through object oriented API's

Shared relational databases are slower to search through for data.

No tables and rows, instead it stores your data in collections made out of individual documents.
