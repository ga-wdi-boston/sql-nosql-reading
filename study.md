## Summary

<!-- your notes here -->

Non-relational is better for bigger data sets where efficiency is key, when each
property is individual, rather than relational. This is best when one object
only has one type, rather than having multiple types.

Social Media: relational database, a person can be a user, friend, poster, or
commenter

TV shows, non relational database: Show has episode, title, director, year, etc
that don't necessarily reference anything else.
