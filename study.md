# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

<!-- your notes here -->

Use Cases:
 - Relational database
   - Provides the ability to link, or relate to another database that has relatable
   - content
   - Provides the ability to create quick ad-hoc queries
   - Provides a robust, time tested solution

 - Non-Relational Database
   - Provides the ability to prevent concurrent edits (using nonce field)
   - Provides the ability to add new fields and data at multiple occasions
   - Must not rely heavily upon a single server capacity and integrity



Strengths of Non-Relational Database
1. Scaleability
2. Lends itself well to agile development environments
3. Server independence

Strengths of Relational Database
1. Transactional integrity
2. Handles 'Big Data' stores more efficiently
3. Lends itself to better security practices (database can be made private)
