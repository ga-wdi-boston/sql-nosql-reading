# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

**Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are appropriate**

- Relational databases are more appropriate when the relationships of the data important. For instance when a user has a post which has many comments made by commenters who are also users.
- Non-relational databases are most appropriate when all of the data you need can be contained in a single document and the relationship of that data does not matter.


**List three strengths of relational databases.**
- It handles data where relationships are important much better
- Ensures data is not duplicated
- Relational schema means you always know what attributes a given table has

**List three strengths of non-relational databases.**
- Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas
- Data and computational load can be shared across multiple servers easily
- Caching is often integrated and does not require a seperate chaching layer
