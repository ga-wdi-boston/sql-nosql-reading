# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

1. It depends on the use case scenario. Each database systems has its own advantages and disadvantages. Very often it isn't possible to predict with 100% certanty which database system would be the best for the given model. Sometimes relational database seems like a good option to start with, but then because datasets can change quickly, NoSQL seems like a better option along the way or vice versa.

If data changes rapidly or growing out quickly or it isn't structured well, then NoSQL can be a good option. Otherwise, SQL.

2. Relational database (SQL)
Strengths
- It is developed 1970. It is well tested open source database system, so it provides a good support;
- It is a structured query language which speeds up the proccess for defining and manipulating the data;
- Easy to use. Intuitive.

3. Non-relational database (NoSQL)
Strengths
- Auto-sharding provides ability to spread data across arbitrary number of servers;
- Quick schema iteration gives ability to evolve data schema without modifying existing data;
- It is a good option for unstructred data.
