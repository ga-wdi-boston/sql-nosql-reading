# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
    When the app have one to many or many to many relationship tables, one would need to use a relational databases. As for non-relational, it is good when one just have single resources table database.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
    1. Standard data access language through SQL.
    1. Data is only stored once
    1. Better security.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
    1. Elastic scaling
    1. Big data Capacity
    1. Uses cluster of cheap commodity servers

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Basically, non-relational database emerged from the lacking of relational database. They provided a more elastic scaling, increased capacity, lower cost servers, etc in comparison to that of the relational ones. However, with the amount of pros, non-relational database still lacks in certain areas. Relational still have a better security and stability as they have been evolved/improved since the 1970s whereas the nonrelation came out only in the 2000s. Overall, it depends on what app needs and wants to do.
