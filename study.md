# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Relational databases which use sql are advantageous for linking information from
different tables trough foreign key. Relational databases are handy for applications
that need complicated querying. However, if we are dealing with huge amount of
data and we don't necessarly need an explicit link between them non relational
databases become more efficient.

In relational databases there are no repetition of data, accordingly it
creates efficiency in storage. As a result of relation ship between datas, querying
data is simpler and maintaining security is easier.

Non-Relational databases are better in performance when we are dealing with
bigger amount of data. Data structure is more flexible and the modal of the data
can be changed without application disruption.
