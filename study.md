# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Relational databases are most useful when the data you need to hold is limited, needs to be read very quickly, and contains predictable data.

Non-relational databases are most useful with very large databases which contain unpredictable data and need to be written very quickly.

Relational databases:
Joins can be very convenient for combining datasets
Does not require you to duplicate data
Fewer invalidation issues

Non-relational databases:
Can contain many types of unpredictable data
Can be stored on multiple servers
Can be written very quickly
