# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NOSQL is important because of its VERSATILITY. 

Appropriate use of relational dbs: Relational databases are best used when scalability is needed, when users identify as numerous types, and when join tables are needed.

Appropriate use of non-relational dbs: best used when the structure of the data is irrelevent, when data entities exist separately, and in one-to-many relationships where there is no overlap in attributes required between relationships for the database to function properly.
