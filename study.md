# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

<!--
NoSQL databases are generally considered to be more scalable and provide superior performance when compared to relational databases. Specifically, non-relational databases address the following issues that relational models are not designed to address:
1. Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
2. Continuious development that takes place in quick iterations.
3. Object-oriented programming that is flexible.
4. Georgraphically distributed scale-out architectures.
Use case motivations include: to scale or perform beyond the capabilities of the existing system, indentify viable alternatives to expense proprietary software, or increase the speed and agility of development.

Decided to read further into Product Data Management in the second reading; specifically, the "Product" "Catalog" document. I thought this example was interesting because it is a very applicable and relatable topic; everyone has bought something online.

The third reading is very interesting but hard to conceptualize. I understand that MongoDB cannot support the value between relationships, but I'm not exactly grasping what they mean when they say "you dont care at all whats inside the JSON"
