# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
    Relational Databases use SQL making them a good choice for applications that
    involve the management of several transactions. If you want your application
    to handle a lot of complicated querying, database transactions and routine
    analysis of data, youâ€™ll want to use a relational database.
    If your data model turns out to be very complex, or if you find yourself
    having to de-normalize your database schema, non-relational databases like
    Mongo may be the best way to go.

-   List three strengths of relational databases.
    1. They are good for transaction management.
    2. Heirarchy and relationships between tables can be maintained using
       relational databases.
    3. RDBMS allow multiple database users to access a database simultaneously.

-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
    1. NOSql has no fixed scheme, so one doesn't need to know the structure of
       the database beforehand. The format of the data model can be changed
       anytime without application driven by the database. This provides
       business flexibility.
    2. It uses lesser server cost.
    3. NOSql can be used to easily capture data, which include unstructured and
       semi structured data.
