# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

## Summary

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.

    -   Use case for non-relational database:
          a.) A Product Catalog for an E-Commerce site because each document
          does not need to have the same schema and as a result each product
          only needs to contain attributes relevant to that product.

          b.) Profile Management - requires an expansive amount of data to
          make a personalized experience for the user, which can be done
          effectively with a NoSql by scaling elastically to meet these demands.

          c.) Mobile Applications - essentially you can scale your database
          as your user base grows versus deploying with a large relational
          database from the beginning.

    -   Use case for relational database:
          a.) From searching the internet, relational databases are a good use
          case for big data. There is a need to manipulate the big data with
          query searches that can find subsets of data and run data analysis
          in real time.

-   List three strengths of relational databases.
    a.) Consistency
    b.) Avoids duplicate data
    c.) Can handle larger amounts of diverse data

-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
    a.) Quick schema integration, minimize
    b.) Support of auto-swarding, which means that it spreads data across
    servers as necessary.
    c.) Data manipulation is object-oriented
