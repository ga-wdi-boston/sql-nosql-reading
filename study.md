-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
    Relational: 1 type (mySQL)
    non-relational: many types

-   List three strengths of relational databases.
    1)Data stored only once which makes it efficient
    2)Better security
    3)Complex queries can be carried out.

-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
    1) Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
    2) Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
    3) Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
