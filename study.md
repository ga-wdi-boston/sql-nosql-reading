# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Non-relational DB:
NoSQL more scalable and provide superior performance.
Data model addresses large volumes of changing data (structured, semi, or unstructured)
Doesn't require predefined schema = changes in real-time w/o interrupting service.
Faster development, reliable code integration, less db administration.
Auto-Sharding

Relational DB:
Schemas must be defined before adding data.
Scaled vertically - single server for entire db
