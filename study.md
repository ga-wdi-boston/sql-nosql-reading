# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

There are several advantages to using a non-relational database, particularly as
it applies to agile development. Relational databases force you to migrate
your entire database to make a change to schema (essentially to put a lot of
time into planning your data models prior to starting development, otherwise
the process to add columns to your database tables can be time-consuming.)

Also, NoSQL databases allow you to split up your databases over many servers
& grow horizontally rather than vertically on one server. This has a lot of
positive impact when it comes to political/geographic implications.

The ultimate choice in whether to use a relational or non-relational database
comes down to the desired functionality & corresponding data models that your
app requires.
