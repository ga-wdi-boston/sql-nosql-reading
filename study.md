# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

1. Use cases of relational database
- social network apps, storing comments etc.

2. Use case of non-relational databases
  - rapidly changing data types
  - high volumes of users
  - accessible form many devices

3. Strengths of relational databases
- less dublicate data
- used when it's clear from the beginning what data type you going to collect
- scale vertically meaning a single server hosts the entire database (more control)
- Stores data in tables

4. Strengths of non-relational databases
  - more scalable, better performance
  - support autosharing (scale horizontally) and therefore data can be spread across mulitiple servers
  - more flexible (no need to store vaiable type before collecting mre suitable for modern web development)
  - frequent code pushes possible (agile development)
  - Stores data in documents in big json objects
