# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NoSQL databases are relational databases and are more scalable. It is meant to address issues other relational databases can't including being able to handle large volumes of constantly changing structured and unstructed data. NoSQL helps development teams work in sprints, pushing code much more frequently. Relational databases scale vertically meaning a single server has to host the entire database. NoSQL is able to support auto-sharding which helps to spread data across multiple servers rather than loading all data on one.

MongoDB is a document-oriented database, it stores data in collections made out of individual documents rather than tables.
