    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

## Summary

Store content and store any kind of data in a single database.

Relational Databases support simple data structures, you don't see redundance or duplication of data and they also offer logical database independence meaning the users do not have to be aware of the underlying structure of the objects in the database.

Non-Relational Databases make a lot of sense when you have a massive distributed dataset, it also can eliminate a lot of ORM issues and it can be a faster option than say Relational Databases.
