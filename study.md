## Summary

Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are appropriate.
  - relational databases: appropriate where every single piece of information matters (logins, transactions)
  - non-relational: where there is a large body of data that changes rapidly, or in environments where features are being pushed too frequently to allow for downtime.

List three strengths of relational databases.
  - well known (in use since 1970s)
  - good for transactions since it doesn't lose data
  - handles self-referential information structures

List three strengths of non-relational databases.
  - Can be spread across multiple servers (better utilization of cloud computing), lending resiliency if one server goes down
  - easier changes to existing db structure
  - more easily scaleable
