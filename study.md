# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Relational: Tabular Data, granular security controls, strict schema requirements, accuracy is critical.
NOSQL: A Single View application aggregates data from multiple sources into a central repository to create a single view of anything. Real Time Analytics.

1) Relational database normalization means that each fact in your data is stored only once, so you shouldn't get data anomalies.
2) Authentication and access privileges are handled better in SQL.
3) You have different types of tabular data that you want to query and manage using dynamic relationships between the data (also known as relational joins).

1) Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture
2) Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
3) Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
