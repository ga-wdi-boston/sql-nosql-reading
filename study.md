As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
    Non-relational databases are most appropriately used in applications that do
    not require relationships between entities. Examples of this include a
    product catalog and a basic television episode information site.
    Relational databases are most appropriately used in applications that have
    relationships between entities. Examples include a recipe app that allows
    users to search by ingredients or a television episode information site that
    allows users to see other shows in which the cast has appeared.

-   List three strengths of relational databases.
  - Allows multiple tables to be joined without duplication of information
  - Centralized database allows the ability for a wholesale change to occur
  - No manual joining necessary

-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
  - Much faster than relational databases for deeply nested non-relational data
  - Not susceptible to SQL injection
  - Able to be sharded across multiple servers
