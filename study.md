# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NoSQL databases were created to help meet the demands of building modern applications.  They're more dynamic, scalable and provide a solution for multi-structured data. NoSQL databases aren't meant to handle relational data though so while they provide benefits in certain use cases, it's definitley not the right solution for every application.  For this reason, it shouldn't be seen as a replacement of an RDMBS system.  Developers should take a look at their applications and requirements to decide whether a SQL or NoSQL database is the correct solution.
