# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

• NoSql uses a wide variety of different technologies.
• Relational databases weren't made to be able to deal with the scale
	of many modern applications. 
• Relational databases are good for large and rapidly changing data.
• Relational databases work well with unstructured data.
• Relational databases handle more code pushes better.
• relational databases need to be migrated everytime a new column is added
	so in this case, a nonrelational database is superior.
• typically a single server must be used with a nonrelational database.
• non relational databases are self healing. 
• non relational databases are easier to plug data into
• non relational databases have easier schema
