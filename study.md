## Summary
-Use relational DBs anytime you want a multi layered data base with little to no
duplicated data.
-NoSQL databases allow data insertion without having a predefined schema.
-Allows easy DB scaling because of the data being shared accroess multiple servers
-Automatically can recover from an outage.
-Relational data bases seem to be better suited for deeply nested data structures.
Which allow for easier retieval of data.
-MangoDB runs into a data duplication problem when dealing with multiple related
data tables.s
