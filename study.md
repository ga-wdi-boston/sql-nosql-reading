# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

<!-- No sql is a tool for non relational databases, or at least for making better
sense out of both relational and non relational databases. If I understood any of this, relational databases make keeping things in one place, and adding data on the fly difficult. However while non relational databases do those things well, they don't allow for data structure to be as defined and take extra measures added in to hold down the structure. Also I would say that single view, would benefit as a non relational data base, 
and catalog is a great example of a relational database.  -->
