## Summary

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.

    1. Data is only stored once, making it easier to delete or modify the data
    2. Through the use of SQL, complicated queries can be carried out.
    3. Better for companies with the potential to grow because it's easier to add features.


-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.
    1. You can store any data types
    2. You can shard data
    3. Scaleable
