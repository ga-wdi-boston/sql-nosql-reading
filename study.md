# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Relational databases are the preferred architecture when dealing with well
defined data-sets as they provide a more structured query set. NoSQL DB's can
handle less defined datasets as they have do not have a schema (or is it just
more flexible?) and therefore allow for horizontal scaling. NoSQL databases
are generally preferred when there will be frequent pushes, feature additions,
or non-uniform data.

Strengths:
RDBMS: often faster queries, well developed/documented technology, long-time
indusry standard

NRDBMS: allow for more flexible data through horizontal scaling, geographic
scaling options, customizable speed (at expense of safety)
