# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Hmmm what is polymorphic data?

"Long gone is the twelve-to-eighteen month waterfall development cycle."
What does this have to do with anything?

"key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents."
okayyyy

"Graph stores include Neo4J and Giraph"
Need more information about these types

Just looked at the link they included to agile development and I don't think
that they actually know what it is. https://www.mongodb.com/agile-development

"Auto-sharding"
Yep, sounds like they'll be sharding themselves a lot

"applications is to scale horizontally, by adding servers instead of concentrating more capacity in a single server."
This I like

The use cases could be very useful for our projects.
