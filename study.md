# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

Relational databases are fine for relatively centralized, unchanging, and/or
simple data structures.  Non-relational databases allow for a lot more rapid
scalability.

Non-relational strengths:

-  Make use of geographically dispersed servers and hardware to store data
-  Make use of agile development, with frequent code pushes and iteration
-  Can use a variety of data structure types

Relational databases:

-  No inherent risk of duplicated data
-  Can use caching to make accessing join tables faster
-  Can nuke and pave from backlog data to fix invalid data caches
