## Summary

Relational databases are appropriate when the data you are storing is sensitive or relavant to the user storing the information where non-realational databases are more appropiate for store mass amounts of data that is used by many users as it is easier to scale.

Relational databases
  1 - secure
  2 - to the point
  3 - written in only SQL

Non-relational databases
  1 - scalable
  2 - fast
  3 - versitile
