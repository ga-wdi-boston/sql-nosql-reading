# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.

-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

<!--
NoSQL databases-
- non-relational
- allow for dynamic changing of database in a short time scale
- can handle lots of data since everything can easily be stored in multiple servers and not just on one- also helps for when one server goes down then there are replacements
- queries can be run faster
- types of databases: document databases, graph stores, key-value stores, wide-column stores
- don't always have standardized rules

SQL databases-
- relational database
- schemas are not particularly dynamic
- gives data a structure that is valuable for storage and querying
- rules that are standardized

NoSQL use cases
  - when you want to store log data (can be queried easily)
  - for creating pre-aggregated data
  - when you need to deploy code quickly and frequently

NoSQL better
- When you want to store LOTS of data, big data
- It's free and open-source
- Flexible data model that can use any type of data and can be easily restructured
- Schemas can easily be modified or do not need to be written when data collection begins

SQL better
- When you want pre-defined rules that ensure that your data does not have a caching problem (when something needs to be updated and can break consistency if needs to be updated in multiple places)
- primary keys and foreign keys allow you to relate tables to one another and prevents caching issues
- Force data integrity by using foreign key constraints
